# Shorelake - Simulating Evolution In Rust



Following the [series](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/) by pwy, I've implemented
- A **Neural Network** from scratch
- A **Genetic Algorithm** to simulate evolution
- A **WebAssembly** based website to show the simulation
 
and my own work
- Ported the simulation to **React** and implemented live graphs of the bird and simulation progress.
